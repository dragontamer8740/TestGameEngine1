# Text Game Engine, Version 1
## a primitive experiment in game design

I'm designing a game engine (primarily for text-based adventures) with a GUI
designed in QT 5.7.

I'm mostly a C/assembly programmer at heart, so this code is pretty ugly right
now, but I hope that over time it can be refined.

I have designed this in QT Creator and recommend that you grab that IDE to
build this, but it is not a strict requirement as long as you have `qmake` and
a text editor.

The license is currently LGPL version 3, because it is my impression that non-
commerical QT projects must be licensed in LGPL3 or compatible. I personally
aim to have this project remain fully compatible with GPLv3 as well (e.g. keep
it working in such a way that no proprietary binaries need to be linked to/
included with it.)

If you want to help out, send a pull request. If you want something added, feel
free to report an issue, but don't expect me to get to it any time soon. I have
a lot more to add and a lot more to think about just to get this project truly
off the ground.
